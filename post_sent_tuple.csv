0,I feel like she's hitting me in the face.,7,-1
1,Who would have been able to just launch her new 14-hour luminous matte concealer?,0,26
1,So we're gonna see how it works and if anything shades match me.,1,1
1,So these are the three colors that I was saying.,2,1
1,This is the three shades match.,3,-1
1,I feel like I'm in between maybe even just this one.,4,5
1,"Also, I wanted to show you guys, I love the way the applicator is.",7,-1
1,"It applies it so smooth and also thick, which I really like.",8,0
1,"I have a darker foundation on today, so I'm gonna go with an in-between shade.",9,1
1,This is how we're rocking the concealer today.,10,26
1,"You guys, look at the way this one's out.",12,9
1,I'm gonna finish the rest of my makeup and I'm gonna test it and see if it does last the 14 hours.,17,0
1,"It is currently 208 and you guys, my skin looks so good.",19,-1
1,I'm gonna see if it lasts 14 hours.,20,0
1,"Go out to dinner, go and do the things that people do in Vegas and then I'm gonna come back and give you guys an update.",22,-1
1,"It is, it is 4444 and this is what our foundation is looking like.",23,-1
1,"You guys, it's just looking really good.",24,9
1,I'm gonna come back once I'm done with dinner.,25,-1
1,"Well, it is 1146 and I've cried a million times and my concealer is still looking really amazing.",26,26
2,"Okay guys, I saw the craziest video on TikTok.",0,20
2,I don't know if it's to get to be true.,1,36
2,So I'm gonna take a little micellar water and I am going to just completely soak up the micellar water.,3,0
2,"Okay, I'm going to be using this teal shade and we're gonna create a little liner.",4,7
2,"Wow, the intensity of that is really incredible.",6,5
2,It's also really smooth when it applies.,7,-1
2,"Okay, should we try this with another color?",8,1
2,Let's try a lighter shade too.,9,1
2,I feel like micellar water might be like the new mixing liquid.,12,-1
2,"Alright, I'm gonna try another shade as well because this is too good.",23,1
2,I'm under this lime green shade right here.,24,1
2,So I'm just gonna go on top and do a thin line now.,26,-1
2,Why are we just discovering this now?,28,-1
2,Put a little mascara on to finish this.,29,0
2,"Oh wow guys, I can't believe how well that worked.",31,21
2,We actually put a cake liner in the palette but apparently all you need is micellar water.,33,7
3,These DIY skip care balls are amazing.,0,-1
3,I can literally see my pores have closed up.,2,16
3,"Oh my god, it is incredible.",3,-1
3,I'm gonna do make a little mess so you wanna make sure you have towels on standby.,4,-1
3,This can care balls to the rescue.,7,-1
5,"Hey beautiful people, so today we have something very exciting to share with you.",0,13
5,You guys know how much I believe in this product.,1,27
5,And it's really exciting because today we're going to reveal one of my favorite versions of this in the entire world.,3,13
5,I'm really excited to show you this.,4,13
5,So I'm going to show you guys our new Lifeliner Quick and Easy.,5,-1
5,"Okay, first of all, it is the easiest liner I have ever used in my entire life.",6,7
5,I've even seen beginners in our company who don't wear eyeliner.,7,0
5,Do the perfect cat eye with this.,8,0
5,It is so easy to use.,9,-1
5,The brush applicator is super fine.,10,17
5,It also has like a constant flow.,11,-1
5,"So no matter what you do, you're always going to continuously get that flow.",12,-1
5,"It also lasts super long too because for me, that's really, really, really important.",15,0
5,The application actually is so fine.,16,-1
5,You can actually even create little hairs with it.,17,28
5,"I know a lot of people who want to use eyeliner, but struggle with or maybe a little intimidated by it.",20,0
5,"This is going to be the liner that's going to be the one to give them the cat eye, the flick, the liner of their dreams.",21,7
5,"Alright, let's get into the facts.",23,-1
5,"It's super long lasting all day wear, waterproof, transfer proof, smudge proof, sweat proof, flake proof.",24,0
5,It does not bleed and it's super easy to remove.,25,3
5,This is going to be your favorite new liner.,26,7
5,"So you can see here the tip is so, so, so fine.",27,-1
5,It's so tiny and this is going to give you really precise application.,28,-1
5,"So if you're somebody who wants to do a liner really quick and maybe you're a little bit scared, this is going to be really easy to use.",29,7
5,"If you're somebody who's going to want to do some really fine art, some very graphic liner, you're going to love this.",30,7
5,So we're going to get into application right now.,31,-1
5,I'm going to go ahead and start.,32,2
5,"We're going to do really simple, classic liner, the easiest liner you could ever imagine.",33,7
5,And what I'm going to do is I'm basically going to look at my bottom water line here and I'm going to continue that as if it's going to continue going.,34,-1
5,So that's going to give me kind of the angle that I need to take.,35,-1
5,"And because this is so fine, you can just do little tiny strokes.",37,-1
5,You don't need to go and do that one little line.,38,38
5,You can actually kind of do these little tiny strokes.,39,-1
5,What I always like to do after I do this is I like to do the next eye too.,40,0
5,So this way I have the same kind of line and I can make sure that it looks similar.,41,-1
5,I'm going to do it before and after.,42,2
5,So I'm not going to do it right now so you guys can see.,43,9
5,But typically what I do is I do one eye here and I would match that on the other eye.,44,0
5,"One thing as well if you want a more lifted eye what you can do is instead of going right at the water line, you can go right above it the way I have here.",45,0
5,So I always like to lift my eyes.,46,0
5,So I actually don't go at the water line and go right above it.,47,38
5,So it's the corner where my upper lid kind of begins.,48,38
5,I like a pretty thick liner.,49,7
5,"If you don't necessarily like a thick liner, then you can definitely adjust the rules for you.",50,7
5,"But since I like a thicker liner, I'm going to go ahead and I'm looking in the mirror.",51,7
5,I'm looking straight and I'm looking to where my iris kind of begins.,52,0
5,And now I'm going to go ahead and connect that.,53,-1
5,So that's giving me a little bit of a little triangle.,54,-1
5,So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to fill this in now.,55,2
5,"If you want to apply thicker liner, I usually always apply thicker liner.",57,7
5,I'm going to make sure that looks really good.,61,-1
5,And I usually what I do is I will go a smidge below the turtleneck and I'll put like a little dot.,64,-1
5,And that's going to be what I'm going to continue and I'm going to connect.,65,-1
5,And a lot of people like to go farther inner towards their nose.,66,22
5,I don't like to do that.,67,2
5,I like to go lower and I feel like it makes my eyes look a little bit more almond and a little bit more lifted.,68,0
5,So I'm going down and I'm just going to go ahead.,69,2
5,I'm drawing this really tiny line here and then I'm going to point it out.,70,38
5,I'm going to do the point first before I draw it out.,71,38
5,"I'm going to lay the pen right on top of my lid here and again, really small strokes.",73,-1
5,And I'm connecting this corner here with the inner corner.,74,38
5,"And if you want, you can connect them.",75,-1
5,You can connect the outer line with the inner liner.,76,7
5,"So you can see I went ahead and finished this eye really easy, super, super simple.",78,0
5,This would normally take me just a couple of minutes to do and you can see the difference in my eye.,79,0
5,I'm going to actually definitely apply some mascara.,80,0
5,"And if you want just a couple lashes on the outer corner, but you can see the difference in my eye.",81,0
5,"It makes me feel sexy, which is the most important thing.",84,18
5,So this is using our new lifeliner quick and easy.,85,7
5,And I'm going to finish it on this side.,86,2
5,"Although some days I wear different makeup on different eyes, but today is not the day.",87,0
5,I'm going to go ahead and finish this eye off camera and then I'm also going to apply a little mascara and I'll be back to show you guys a final look.,88,0
5,"Okay guys, so this is the final look, a really simple wing liner, a little bit in the corner.",89,7
5,I put some legit lashes mascara as well as a couple of lashes here on the outer corner.,90,0
5,And I am loving this look.,91,35
5,This is a really easy daytime look.,92,-1
5,"It could be nighttime for some people as well for me, maybe not so much.",93,-1
5,"And if I were to choose only three products to use for the rest of my life, this would definitely be one of them.",94,27
5,I can't wait for you guys to try this.,95,21
5,I hope you guys enjoyed the video.,96,-1
5,Do not be afraid to use liner because you guys are going to love this one.,97,7
5,This is going to make your life so much easier and I can't wait to see you guys later.,98,-1
6,"Okay guys, I'm gonna be testing out this hack.",0,20
6,I've seen it on the internet and I wanna know if this is a hack or hype.,1,20
6,"Okay guys, I'm gonna be testing out this hack.",2,20
6,I've seen it on the internet and I wanna know if this is a hack or hype.,3,20
7,"This was Halloween singing La Everyday is Friday night I hate out of mind And I'm a side Kiss me, hug me Holy time singing La Let me take you in through the back door Let me show you the shame we won Everybody go round and round Get busy on the swing and shown Let's have a cool afternoon",0,0
8,The new HUWD palette rose boards is here.,1,4
8,So the packaging is absolutely beautiful and this is how the palette looks from inside.,2,-1
8,"There we have some pinks going on, we have a lot of pigments and stuff and some people were saying that it's similar to naughty palette but I would have to disagree because here's the naughty palette and here's the new rose boards palette and I feel like the storyline is their friends, some of the shades may look similar but those are transition shades and it kind of makes sense to always have those warm browns in it in the palette but now we are going to try this over here.",3,-1
8,The first shade I'm going to grab is gratitude and I'm going to put that in my crease to act as my transition shade.,4,1
8,It has a pink undertone to it but it's like a matte finish and it looks really nice and subtle.,5,1
8,"It's not too shong, there's not a lot of fallout happening so I'm happy about that and I can't wait to try the pigments because I heard in this palette there's a lot of new formulas for the pigments itself.",6,8
8,"I finished it all with the matte, I am going to grab this shade and I'm going to do first with my finger just to kind of see who this looks so pretty.",7,10
8,"And I'm going to also try it, oh my god, this is literally studying and it just applies like butter.",9,-1
8,"This is absolutely beautiful, oh my god.",11,-1
8,On this side I'm going to try it with a little brush as well just because I want to see if it applies with the brush.,12,17
8,It does but the payoff is definitely much better with a finger so figure it is.,13,-1
8,"Final look, honestly I am so happy with the pigments, I swatched the other ones.",14,-1
8,"The payoff is insane, I would literally buy this palette just because of the pigments I swear.",15,8
8,"It is so pretty, no fallouts.",16,-1
8,The matte kind of makes sense because they get along with the pigments that you're going to be using.,17,-1
8,Honestly it is so pretty and the whole storyline kind of makes sense with the whole squirrels vibe and the packaging and stuff so I don't know what do you guys think.,18,-1
9,Change your whole routine and try this instead.,1,0
9,"Then after moisturizing, take some translucent powder.",3,0
9,I usually use the fit me one and I just lightly dab it all over my face.,4,0
9,I usually use the NYX one.,8,19
9,"After the setting spray, take a primer and just put your primer.",9,0
9,"Also, wait for the setting spray to dry first.",10,0
9,Then just put on your foundation and just see what happens.,11,0
9,How amazing your makeup is going to look.,12,0
9,It's going to stay on 24-7 and it's not going to crease.,13,-1
9,It's a technique that's probably still used by so many other people.,14,-1
9,I heard that it's been used for a long time.,15,-1
9,I just found out about it and honestly look.,16,-1
9,I don't have the beautiful turon.,17,35
9,Try it on you and let me know if it works.,18,21
10,"I wanted to do a tutorial using our Color Buck palette, but I wanted to use two tones of purple.",0,-1
10,"I'm gonna start out using our Chin Lift, and I'm going to be using these Rose Quartz facial massaging tools to get a little bit of drainage and make sure my jaw is super snatched.",1,-1
10,"I'm also gonna be using our eyelift patches, gonna help me with any fallout while I'm creating this look.",2,0
10,"I'm grabbing a medium shade purple and putting it all over the crease and the brow bone, and then I'm gonna clean up the edges to create a really nice defined shadow.",3,-1
10,I'm going to use a lighter purple all over the lid and I'm really packing that on.,4,-1
10,I'm gonna use the cake liner to create a really beautiful eye line and to go in there and really define the two different shades.,5,7
10,"And now let's start with the complexion, applying one of my favorite primers foundation, going in with a little concealer.",6,26
10,"I'm gonna bake, finish the rest of my look, and this is it.",7,-1
11,"Name a bigger complexion stand than me, spoiler alert, you can't.",0,14
11,Huda Beauty just launched the hashtag foful filter concealer.,1,-1
11,This is my first time trying it.,2,21
11,So I have three shades that they sent me and we're going to swatch them and test them now.,3,1
11,"This is what brittle looks like on my complexion, so it's a little light.",4,14
11,I think maybe two light from my light.,5,-1
11,So the next shade is peanut butter.,6,-1
11,"This is peanut butter right here, and this is butter scotch.",7,-1
11,"Look at what the swatches on the website, and I think peanut butter is going to be an okay shade, but I honestly feel like I'm somewhere in between crumble and salted caramel.",8,-1
11,I'm going to try to see if I can make peanut butter work.,9,-1
11,I think it's the closest the best I can do right now.,10,2
11,And I'm not color correcting because I want to see what this does on its own.,11,-1
11,"While I blend this out, I'm going to read some stats.",12,2
11,"It's described as luminous matte and a skin like finish, which I can definitely see.",13,-1
11,I'm not going to lie so far.,14,2
11,I'm not really mad at the coverage.,15,-1
11,"And that blended out real fast, and I'm not going to lie.",16,2
11,I'm quite surprised as I pull away how not stand out is like this looks like my skin.,17,14
11,I usually expect matte like products to not look like this seamless on my bare complexion because I'm not wearing any foundation.,18,14
11,"This actually looks really, this actually looks really good.",20,35
11,I'm going to add just a little bit more.,22,2
11,"I'm going to do full face, and then come back into my eye.",24,0
11,"I'm not going to lie, but I see so far.",25,2
11,"I mean, I'm just being honest.",26,36
11,"And so far, I like what I see.",28,35
11,I'm actually surprised with the coverage.,29,-1
11,I rarely get this good coverage without correcting first.,31,-1
11,"I'll check back in a few hours, but so far.",32,2
12,I've never been early to anything.,3,2
12,I hope you guys are doing really well.,12,13
12,Which is strange for me because I usually...,14,-1
12,But it's so great to connect with you guys today.,16,13
12,And I'm going to be sharing with you guys some really interesting things talking about our Rose Quartz collection in just lunch yesterday.,17,4
12,And I'm so excited to share everything with you guys.,18,13
12,And we're going to be chatting.,19,-1
12,We're going to be talking here.,20,2
12,And we're going to be connecting.,21,-1
12,So I'm really excited to do this with you guys.,22,13
12,So we're going to try to pin some products while we're talking.,23,-1
12,This is the first time we're doing it too.,24,-1
12,"So if it's not smooth, please excuse us.",25,-1
12,We're going to try to make it as smooth as possible.,26,-1
12,I see all of you guys.,30,-1
12,So I'm going to go through really quickly showing you guys a little bit of the products they just launched yesterday.,33,-1
12,And thank you guys to everyone out there who supported the launch.,35,-1
12,I love you guys so much.,36,31
12,And thank you so much for the support.,37,-1
12,I want to talk first before we get into the products.,38,-1
12,You guys may have seen some of these sexy products.,39,27
12,I've seen it everywhere on the internet.,41,20
12,And we'll get into it in a minute.,43,2
12,"But first, before we go there, I want to tell you guys about the inspiration behind the collection.",44,-1
12,This is our Rose Quartz collection.,45,4
12,"It is a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 piece collection.",46,4
12,"And the inspiration for it was really just love, self-love.",48,-1
12,"I've spoken openly before about my self-love journey, about some of the issues I experienced.",49,15
12,I remember actually when I first started to underline some of the things that I was going through.,50,38
12,"It was 2017, I think, some time around that.",51,-1
12,"And my life coach was asking me the question, she said, do you love yourself?",52,15
12,"And I was like, no, I don't love myself.",53,15
12,And it really was like a moment for me that kind of was like the beginning of my healing and the beginning of me understanding some of the things I was doing that I wasn't prioritizing myself and I wasn't doing those things that I should be doing.,54,15
12,So it was a really amazing moment.,55,5
12,"And when I moved to my new house, I wanted to just put crystals in it that kind of represented self-love and healing and all those things.",56,4
12,So I put rose quartz everywhere in the house.,57,4
12,Maybe at the end we'll do a quick little tour.,58,2
12,"But I was really inspired by the crystals in the house because they were just, they were really beautiful.",60,4
12,There were so many different colors on colors.,63,-1
12,"And it just was really, really inspiring.",64,5
12,So we were putting all these shadows on a piece of rose quartz.,65,4
12,We got to do rose quartz collection.,66,4
12,So that's what we have here.,67,-1
12,So you guys probably have seen the palette already.,68,8
12,So I'm going to try to open this up.,69,34
12,I can't do anything in my nose.,70,22
12,"If I can open it up, there we go.",71,34
12,And you guys can see the colors are gorgeous.,72,1
12,We normally do more warmer tone palettes.,73,8
12,And this one was very much inspired by those cool earthy tones that you see in the rose quartz.,74,4
12,So we got some beautiful grays and beautiful.,75,-1
12,"We have some blending tones that are a little bit more on the cool side, but they're still browns.",76,-1
12,We have these beautiful pinks and we have these amazing shades.,77,1
12,"I've never seen anything like them in a palette before, but these duo chrome that I cannot even tell you how gorgeous they are.",78,8
12,They are so stunning and so beautiful.,79,-1
12,And they just have like these different shades.,80,1
12,"When you move them in the light, they give like this insane reflection.",81,-1
12,But we put in three shades like that.,83,1
12,We have one which is moon magic.,84,-1
12,"We have another one which is cosmic love, which is a bit darker.",85,-1
12,And then we also have the other one which is right here.,86,18
12,So we put three duo chrome in there because they kind of give you the idea of like energy.,88,-1
12,And like they just give this like this feels like an aura.,89,5
12,"I don't know if you guys are feeling it, but it feels like an aura.",90,5
12,"And when people put it on across the board, like across the room, wherever you see them, you can actually see the shade like reflecting this amazing just like duo chrome and duo colors.",91,1
12,So that is two of the shades I love are sorry three of the shades I love within the palette.,93,-1
12,Each one of them has like a different reflection.,95,1
12,So each one of them is going to give you a very different effect.,96,-1
12,I've also mixed all of them.,97,-1
12,And I'm going to let you guys pick what I do.,98,9
12,So maybe we can I'll start a little something.,99,2
12,You guys can tell me what you guys want to see.,100,9
12,And then we'll play with it at the end.,101,2
12,But we also have something that is really incredible with our big palettes.,102,8
12,We always want to bring you the best innovation.,103,-1
12,And a lot of time working on it.,104,-1
12,So not like your normal metallics.,107,-1
12,Like it's almost like liquid in a shadow form.,109,-1
12,"It's they're just so soft, so delicious.",110,1
12,"But they also stick, which is so incredible as well.",111,-1
12,"And of course, you know, we have our beautiful maps that work so well.",113,-1
12,They're so pigmented and so beautiful.,114,-1
12,There is a little bit of fallout when you use them.,115,24
12,But that's because we went for the intense pigmentation.,116,1
12,And they're just they're so gorgeous.,117,-1
12,You're going to absolutely love wearing them.,118,-1
12,I've always had a hard time wearing matte eyeshadows because I have like.,121,10
12,I don't know if there are dimples on my eyes.,123,0
12,"There shouldn't be there, but they're there.",125,-1
12,"So when I put the mats on, I can actually create a really beautiful smooth kind of transition.",126,-1
12,And it looks stunning and you don't really see the indent.,127,35
12,I always struggled with like matte shadows that are not smooth.,128,-1
12,And we want to make the smoothest maps.,129,-1
12,"But I can't leave this shadow at last, but at least love stone.",131,12
12,"We had something similar in our naughty nude that slippery, delicious, glossy finish that like I know everybody wants right now.",132,1
12,We created something just like that.,133,-1
12,And we should try to take it a little bit further.,134,-1
12,We made it a little bit.,135,-1
12,It kind of glosses a little bit better.,136,10
12,So it does kind of set a little bit more.,138,-1
12,"But for this one, we actually put these like little shards.",139,12
12,It looks like little shards of crystal.,140,12
12,"It's not actual shards, but it's in the shape of that.",142,12
12,So usually what we do is we drop them in and we make them really nice and round.,143,37
12,"We dropped them in rough, making them look like crystals.",144,12
12,So you have these little white kind of iridescent ones and these pink ones.,145,1
12,"There's a lot of duo chrome in there, but they are stunning.",146,-1
12,So there's a lot happening in this palette.,147,8
12,I can't believe how much I love a cool palette because it's not it's not usually what works for me.,151,8
12,But we worked so hard to make sure that it worked on all skin tones.,152,14
12,And then the formulations are just insane.,156,30
12,So I'm going to show you guys cosmic love too because it's so gorgeous.,159,-1
12,It's like this marble kind of effect.,160,-1
12,"You got the purple, the blue duo chrome.",161,-1
12,I'm going to put it right here in the middle.,164,2
12,You don't see these shades in palettes very often.,166,8
12,"You know, it's very, very, I personally never seen anything this intense.",167,5
12,So I'm really excited for you guys to try it.,168,-1
12,"I am going to do a look for you guys using this palette, but I just want to show you guys a couple more things before we do.",169,8
12,I would do it real quick.,170,2
12,This is our look how gorgeous this packaging is.,171,1
12,This is our wishful rose quartz peel off mask.,173,4
12,I used it yesterday in the morning.,174,-1
12,"It peeled everything off all my pores, like all the dirt that was in my pores.",175,16
12,It was such a gratifying feeling.,177,5
12,All my desk and I loved it so much.,178,5
12,And this actually has rose quartz mineral powders.,179,4
12,"It comes like this has a little spooly or a little, a little applicator there.",180,-1
12,It actually has crushed rose quartz mineral powder in it.,188,4
12,"It's really, really amazing for actually clarifying your skin.",190,14
12,So it has some really amazing ingredients.,191,-1
12,"Watermelon rose quartz, hyaluronic acid, and lotus flower.",192,4
12,But I just love this packaging.,194,1
12,I want it just for the packaging alone.,196,1
12,We did this kind of rose quartz effect.,197,4
12,And we did that on all of our packaging.,198,-1
12,So you can see it's also on the palette.,200,8
12,It looks like a piece of stone.,201,12
12,I'm going to move on to our rose quartz face gloss because you guys have been talking about it.,203,4
12,Let's just get right into it.,205,2
12,A lot of people said it looked weird.,207,-1
12,"Actually, well, before I get in there, I need to pin.",208,-1
12,I need to pin it so you guys can find it easily.,210,2
12,So let me unpin the palette.,212,8
12,"So in case you guys want to find it, it's easy.",213,9
12,Let me see if I can do this rose quartz.,216,4
12,In case you guys want to find it's going to be easy to find.,221,9
12,I saw a lot of comments.,223,-1
12,"A lot of people will like, ew, it looks gross.",224,18
12,It looks like a Petri dish.,225,12
12,"I mean, maybe a little bit.",228,-1
12,"Like, things like that look sometimes a little weird can be incredible.",230,-1
12,And this is 100% one of them.,231,-1
12,"Everybody I saw online was like, oh my god, it looks weird.",232,18
12,"Guys, this is a new way to highlight.",235,33
12,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm just over the highlighters that are going to be the highlighters that are glittery and then overly shimmery and just look like, like you're like beaming.",236,33
12,We want to look dui and delicious and beautiful.,238,10
12,And because of the gel and there's different ones.,239,-1
12,"Some of them have less pearls than others, but it doesn't really matter.",240,25
12,It gives you the same effect.,241,-1
12,"Because of the gel and because of the pearls, the mix actually makes your skin look dui.",242,-1
12,"And because it's gel base instead of the pearls, usually for me when I put a highlighter on, it kind of magnifies my pores.",245,-1
12,It goes around the pore and then it looks like a little bit like a crater.,246,16
12,"I'm like, my skin looked better before I put the highlighter on.",247,-1
12,"With this, it actually looks more amazing.",249,35
12,It makes your skin look soft.,250,16
12,It makes it look glossy and dui and just beautiful.,251,10
12,So I'm going to really quickly just show you guys what happens when you swirl it.,252,-1
12,"So you get a little bit of something happening, right?",253,36
12,"It kind of glazes the top and you get a little bit of this, too.",254,10
12,"It doesn't look like that much, right?",255,-1
12,It doesn't look like any's happening.,257,-1
12,"You put it on your face, though.",258,0
12,And you start to get the shimmeriness that is stunning.,259,25
12,"And honestly, I like to use my fingers.",260,0
12,This doesn't really require too much to it.,261,-1
12,All you need to do is use your fingers and apply it slowly.,262,0
12,And you can go bare face.,263,0
12,You can put it on top of makeup.,264,0
12,"You can go when you do, when you're natural, there's so many ways to wear this.",265,0
12,And it just kind of gives your face this glossiness.,267,10
12,"And it just, I don't know, softens your pores in a way.",268,16
12,I just want to put it all over my face.,269,0
12,I'm going to quickly put it all over my face because I love it so much.,270,0
12,I did have some on earlier.,271,-1
12,But this is like a little addictive.,272,18
12,"I've gone through one, which is kind of crazy because it was going to go through that.",273,5
12,But I've gone through one already.,274,-1
12,So you can see it just kind of gives my skin that soft look.,276,-1
12,I'm going to go my nose as well.,277,22
12,And the reviews of this from all the influencers we sent to were just so amazing.,278,30
12,"And it was so nice to see everyone was like, I don't know if I like this.",279,5
12,"And then when they put it on, they loved it.",281,5
12,It was just so nice to see.,282,5
12,We kind of knew that was going to happen.,283,-1
12,"We're like, people are either going to say this looks weird or they're going to love it.",284,18
12,And it was so nice seeing people actually love it.,285,5
12,I was really happy to see that.,286,5
12,"Okay, I'm going to move on really quickly to our silk bomb.",287,-1
12,I know you guys love this formula.,288,-1
12,I've seen it so many times.,289,-1
12,It has a lot of really amazing ingredients in it.,292,30
12,The smell I've heard also people are obsessed with a smell.,294,-1
12,I don't know how to explain it.,297,9
12,But you can put a little bit on your lips.,299,3
12,And it does provide a little hydration.,300,0
12,But it also does have a little bit of a shimmer too.,301,25
12,This one also has rose quartz mineral powder in it as well.,302,4
12,And it's just like a nice little gloss.,303,10
12,"And firstly for me, like the reason why I left silk bomb is I feel like it hydrates my lips over time as well.",306,3
12,This one has a little bit of a shade.,308,1
12,"It's called Love Stone as well, which matches the Love Stone shade kind of into palette.",309,-1
12,"The one in the palette, it depends, right?",310,8
12,"Because it has like broke, like it's just literally dropped pigments.",311,1
12,So it could be a little bit more of the shade.,312,1
12,That's kind of the beauty of some of these palettes that we create.,313,8
12,"When we do these marble effects are these like kind of, you know, these like slippery kind of shades.",314,-1
12,You never really know what you're going to get in the palette.,316,8
12,They're all perfect in their own little way.,319,6
12,But they all give you an amazing effect.,320,30
12,"So now that my face is really glossy, I think I went a little crazy.",321,10
12,I am going to move on to the tutorial.,322,-1
12,"Oh, before I do that, I'm going to show you guys the brushes.",323,17
12,These are not actual rose quartz.,325,4
12,But we did make them also inspired by rose quartz.,327,4
12,You get this beautiful effect there too.,328,-1
12,I have so many of them.,331,18
12,One because they're really light and easy to use.,332,19
12,But also just because they're bomb brushes.,333,-1
12,"And I just like that they're, they're pretty good price as well.",335,-1
12,So you get three for a really nice price.,336,-1
12,So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to just add some makeup on to my look right now.,337,0
12,I'm not going to go crazy.,338,2
12,"If you guys, I'm actually, sorry, I've been so focused on saying what I need to say.",339,-1
12,And I was a little bit nervous.,340,5
12,That I was not looking at the comments here and there because I was going to give it nervous.,341,23
12,So I'm going to really get into your comments now.,342,-1
12,So you guys tell me what you guys want to see.,343,9
12,And thank you guys so much for tuning in and staying on.,344,31
12,And we can kind of create a look together.,346,36
12,So I'm actually going to start first by showing you guys.,347,-1
12,"Oh, let me just really quickly switch again to the eyeshadow palette.",348,8
12,So I'm going to pin that again because that's what I'm going to talk about right now.,349,2
12,"I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to do a look.",353,2
12,I'm going to do a look.,354,-1
12,"Oh, you don't have to make an appearance.",357,-1
12,So I'm going to now move on to the look really quickly.,366,-1
12,So I'm going to show you guys using love stones.,367,12
12,So love stone is a really cool kind of shimmery.,368,12
12,"Oh, guys, nor I want to make it appear.",370,9
12,Do you want to do a look on me?,378,-1
12,"No, you do a look on only at the end if people still want to do that too.",380,-1
12,I'm going to give you some pink.,390,1
12,"So first, I'm going to go ahead and start out with the love stone shade.",392,12
12,I just want to show you guys.,393,9
12,"Actually, I'm going to just swatch it.",394,-1
12,So you guys can see how it applies.,395,9
12,So it's got like this weird.,396,-1
12,And I'm actually going to apply it here.,398,-1
12,And it has some shimmeriness to it too.,399,25
12,So you can see it gives you this wet look.,400,-1
12,"So you know, a lot of us want that glossy look on our eyes.",401,10
12,Like nobody really can put it on without moving all over the place.,408,-1
12,So this kind of gives you that look.,409,-1
12,I do have some cheats on how to do it.,410,20
12,So I will try to show you guys some different techniques on how to do it.,411,-1
12,"Really, really glossy without putting this and smudering your eye with it.",412,10
12,Because there are some places where you put it.,413,-1
12,"And when you move, it just looks glossy.",414,10
12,It looks like everything you want it to look like.,418,19
12,So I'm going to show you guys really quickly some of the technique on that.,419,-1
12,So I'm going to grab the shade left.,420,1
12,So I'm actually just using a paintbrush.,421,17
12,This is a really cheap paintbrush.,422,17
12,Sometimes I just like to use these like long brushes like this.,425,17
12,And I'm going to show you guys really quickly some of the technique on that.,426,-1
12,And I'm going to use it to just kind of place love stone here.,427,12
12,And I like to go right here along the crease.,428,-1
12,And you can see already my eye looks a little dewy and a little wet.,429,0
12,So I'm just going to apply it there.,430,0
12,"And I'm going to go again, apply another layer.",431,0
12,"I'm now going to apply a small amount here, right here.",432,0
12,"And now I'm already getting the effect of like a wet eye, right?",433,0
12,So now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to blend out those edges to kind of almost make them blend together.,434,-1
12,"I barely have any product on my eye, by the way.",435,0
12,There's like barely any product on my eye.,436,0
12,"Now if you really want to intensify that, you can go ahead and take that moon magic shape, which is my favorite shade in the entire palette.",437,-1
12,It's just like in a small amount using this brush.,439,17
12,"This is not even like, you know, this is, this is super simple.",441,5
12,And I'm going to use that base.,442,-1
12,I'm going to use a base of love stone.,444,12
12,And I am going to just apply it on top of that.,445,0
12,And I'm going to start blending that out.,446,-1
12,So I'm just going to blend it out.,448,-1
12,And that love stone kind of like works to make this even more intense.,449,12
12,My eyes are looking really wet.,451,0
12,But I still want to give you a pink look.,460,1
12,Because I know you asked for a pink look.,461,1
12,"So okay, I'm going to go, geez, I don't know what shade to go for.",462,1
12,"By the way, I did the most amazing tutorial yesterday.",463,-1
12,I do adjust the mats in the palette.,464,8
12,"Oh my god, with a little concealer underneath it.",467,26
12,"Oh my god, it was so beautiful.",468,-1
12,"So I'll kind of, I'll do something different on this eye.",470,0
12,Or should we do the same?,474,-1
12,Should we just keep adding pigments?,475,1
12,I want to make you guys happy.,476,-1
12,So you guys tell me what you guys want to see.,477,9
12,"Okay, you guys want the metallic?",481,-1
12,"All right, I'm going to give you guys what you want.",482,9
12,"All right, so I'm going to go ahead and finish this.",483,2
12,And then we'll add more pigment around the eyes.,484,10
12,So I'm grabbing love stone again.,485,12
12,"Literally small amount, not a lot.",486,-1
12,I'm shaping out the lid here.,488,-1
12,"It's like, it's not a cut crease, but it's like the modern way of doing a cut crease.",490,-1
12,I'm grabbing a tiny bit of moose.,496,-1
12,So I barely put my brush in there.,497,17
12,And I'm going to do the same thing here.,498,2
12,"It just gives you that wet look, especially because mood magic is also duochrome.",501,-1
12,So you're getting all of that wetness from all of this mix.,502,-1
12,"It's just, it's just so sexy.",503,-1
12,I'm so glad you guys like it.,504,31
12,Do you guys want to ask me any questions too?,507,-1
12,You guys can ask me anything.,508,9
12,"You tell me what you guys want to know about the collection, even outside the collection.",510,4
12,You guys tell me what you guys want to know.,511,9
12,I am here to talk about anything.,512,2
12,Try to read your comments and do the makeup at the same time.,513,0
12,"Oh, you guys are so cute.",514,31
12,"Grabbing a little mood magic, putting that on top of that left stone.",517,12
12,That left stone works so amazing under the base of any these shades.,518,12
12,"So like, for instance, if I take this shade right here, I'll take another left stone swatch.",519,-1
12,"I'm going to do another one on this part of my hand, right?",520,0
12,This is the plain left stone.,521,12
12,You guys saw the cosmic love.,525,-1
12,"I'm going to grab blissful, which is this like, it's a little like greenish, a little, it's got a weird color to it.",527,1
12,And I'm going to just take it there.,530,-1
12,"And you can see again, like the wetness, the sexiness.",531,-1
12,"It gives you a aura vibe, right?",533,-1
12,Do you guys feel the energy?,534,5
12,Do you feel that vibe from this?,535,5
12,"It's like, you know, from this, I just, I feel it.",538,5
12,I feel it's like full energy.,539,5
12,I just had like bronzer in my eyelid.,545,-1
12,"Like, that was so freaking easy.",548,5
12,"I'm just going to quickly grab, mhm, what color should I put in my... Ugh.",550,1
12,Mantra is one of the most amazing shades here.,551,1
12,I don't know if you guys can see it.,553,9
12,It's such an amazing darker shade.,555,1
12,Maybe I'll do a little bit of that in the corner here.,556,2
12,So I always grab a post it.,557,34
12,I'm going to grab a post it.,559,-1
12,And I'm just going to hold it up to my eyelid here.,560,0
12,And just so I get a clean line.,561,-1
12,And I'm going to grab some of that mantra.,562,-1
12,I don't know if you guys can see it.,564,9
12,It's the most amazing liner shade.,565,1
12,So if you guys can see it.,567,9
12,"But it's just, it's like one of the most perfect colors I think we've ever created for like that liner kind of smoky look.",568,1
12,"I mean, can you see the difference?",569,-1
12,"This is like really, I love it.",570,-1
12,I did have it on from earlier today.,571,-1
12,We can even take it up a little bit here.,573,-1
12,So does I like to do that?,574,2
12,"It's not really a black, but it's got this cool tone to it.",577,1
12,It's like a necessary shade inside of a palette.,579,-1
12,But look how pigmented that was too.,580,1
12,I think we got a little tiny bit of fallout.,581,-1
12,So I don't know if you guys can see a small mouth.,582,3
12,"If you guys can see a small mouth, it's really minimal.",584,3
12,"But when you have a dark shade and it falls out like that, it does kind of show up, which is why I did want to call that out.",585,1
12,I was nervous to do this live.,588,-1
12,Did I really say that on the live?,590,-1
12,I said that on the live.,592,-1
12,"Okay, I guess I'll do the same thing to the other side as well.",595,-1
12,And then I don't know what other shades do I show you guys?,596,-1
12,"Oh, you know what I'm going to do?",597,2
12,I'm actually going to show you guys really quickly too.,598,9
12,One thing that I love to do.,599,-1
12,I always love to put like a light shade in the corner here.,600,1
12,We'll end the video here and all.,601,-1
14,I'm gonna teach you guys my signature lip technique.,1,3
14,"First, I'm gonna start off by applying concealer to my entire lip.",2,3
14,This is gonna help me start with a blank canvas.,3,38
14,Then I'm going to contour my lips.,4,-1
14,"I'm using our Tantor, applying it to the cupid's bow, the bottom of the lip, and the top.",5,0
14,"Next, I'm gonna start by using lip contour and terracotta.",6,3
14,This is a really nice warm pink.,7,1
14,"I love it, and I'm gonna put a little bit on the edge of the lips as well to get a really nice sexy shape.",8,3
14,"I'm gonna apply a liquid lipstick that matches lip contour all over my lip, and then I'm gonna go in with a lighter shade just in the center.",9,3
14,"Next, I'm gonna add a little bit of liner just to the outer corners.",10,7
14,"This is gonna help me turn the corners of my mouth upward, giving me a little bit of a cute pout.",11,3
14,I hope you guys like this video.,12,-1
15,Let's do a look with this palette.,0,8
15,I'm going to start with this shade.,1,1
15,Notice the eyeshadow is only on one side of the brush.,2,-1
15,Flip that side towards the ceiling and then start to press it into the socket.,3,0
15,So now I took this orange and we're going to start to tap that above the purple.,4,-1
15,There's a method to the makeup madness I promise.,8,0
15,Just kind of keep layering that and tapping that to blend.,9,-1
15,Now we need to grab the eyeshadow on the tip of the brush and from here we're going to take that and press it in between the orange and the dark purple.,10,-1
15,That's what's going to create that really soft smooth transition.,11,-1
15,Let's grab this peach shade and we're going to take this almost all the way up to our brow one and look how that just kind of smoothed everything together.,12,0
15,I showed a base to cut the crease.,13,-1
15,By the way look at the swatches.,14,1
15,I think we're going to go with this so we can use the cake liner.,15,7
15,Let's grab this gorgeous orange shimmer.,16,25
15,"Oh lord, how much does it see my brain.",18,-1
15,So we really wanted to set the base as quick as possible.,20,-1
15,Now I'm going to switch to a smaller brush and just kind of do some detail work on the lid.,21,17
15,So I'm going to leave through here blank.,22,2
15,The reason why is because we're going to put liner there.,23,7
15,And anytime you try to put liner on top of shimmer you're risking it.,24,7
15,My solar water going into the cake liner.,26,7
15,Just kind of pinching it to my natural lashes.,30,0
15,Complexion will be in a separate video.,32,14
15,Check the post before this one for the complexion.,34,14
15,And there's an even more in-depth tutorial on my IG story.,35,-1
15,Love the palette and I absolutely love the way this look turned out.,36,8
16,"Alright, slugging under makeup, let's see.",0,0
16,"She's gonna go with Vaseline, okay?",2,0
16,"If she's slugging, she's mixing Vaseline with her foundation.",4,0
16,I have put Pilugasamon before I put my makeup on.,7,-1
16,It's not the same thing as slugging.,8,0
16,So I will put on a pea-sized underneath my makeup.,9,0
16,"Doesn't necessarily make my makeup look better, but it helps prevent my skin from looking dry throughout the day.",10,16
16,One of the reasons why people start slugging in the first place was to prevent your skin from losing moisture.,11,0
16,"I use Pilugasam, which is what I used to slug.",12,0
16,"I put a lot on at night, and then I put a small amount on during the day, just because I became so obsessed with the way it's really helped my pores.",13,16
16,So feel free to use it during the day and night.,14,0
16,"Just remember, when you're using it at daytime, use a small amount.",15,-1
17,I'm gonna show you guys how to get a really sharp liner using a post-it.,0,7
17,I basically want to align the post-it with this small little curve here on my waterline and I'm going to grab a little black eyeliner and I'm just gonna go ahead and close my eyes and I'm just drawing in here and I'm going along the lash line here and you want the point to kind of end at a sharp point.,1,0
17,So this is really important if you want to like look downward towards your mirror so you don't get that crease.,2,-1
17,Now using a liner brush I'm just gonna grab a little great eyeshadow and I'm gonna start smoking it out and you can kind of just draw on top of where you drew the liner and you kind of want to draw a little bit of a triangle here and I'm going all along the lash line here and it will really fade but that's okay.,3,-1
17,I'm gonna grab this brown eyeshadow and I'm gonna put it on top of that and then I'm gonna grab the black eyeshadow and I'm gonna go on top of this.,4,1
17,I'm getting all these really natural kind of smoky tone.,5,1
17,The only thing is I want this to be neat on top right here so I'm mixing that brown and I'm gonna grab this black.,6,1
17,All right and now I'm just gonna remove the post-it and you can see how clean that liner is and it's so nice and smoky.,7,7
17,I'm gonna put some lashes on I'm gonna finish this side of my face and I'm gonna come back and you can see I finished my liner I added some lashes and my look is final.,8,0
18,Moose removes gum from your hair.,2,28
18,I always thought you got gum in your hair.,3,-1
18,There was no way to get out.,5,18
18,But I'm gonna give this a try.,7,21
18,So I'm gonna choose some gum.,8,28
18,"And if this doesn't work, I'm gonna really mad at Leah because she made me do it.",9,-1
18,I don't know if I want to move to my hair.,10,28
18,I bet she used her hair.,13,-1

18,I'm gonna put it on the end.,16,2
18,"Well, the gum doesn't even like, it just like sticks to the hair.",21,28
18,It's not the same moose that they use.,23,-1
18,I don't have that one right now.,24,-1
18,It doesn't feel like it works at all.,28,-1
18,I guess you just have to give it a second.,32,2
18,It literally just like separates the gum from your hair.,36,28
18,It just makes it not sticky anymore.,37,0
18,It feels like a piece of like dried slime now.,38,10
18,I'm so freaking gasped right now.,40,-1
18,"So I'm gonna use a comb to like just get out any, look at that.",42,28
18,I tried this video because I have got gum stuck in my hair before as all of us have.,47,28
18,"And hopefully if you know anybody who gets gum stuck in the hair, you can be like, I know how to get it.",48,28

20,"So this is really, really exciting.",15,13

20,"And when you open it up, you have this.",23,34
20,You also have the Queen of Sheba kind of shade there and this beautiful gold and the shade is this beautiful pink nude.,24,1
20,Herod's has a very special place in my heart.,25,-1
20,It was our first retailer in the UK that took us on board and welcome this into the UK.,26,19
20,And it's been such an incredible journey.,27,5
20,And this product is really special as well.,28,-1
20,So I'm gonna start first by y'all going my lips.,29,3
20,I always love to do this when I'm wearing anything like a liquid lipstick or anything that's more mattifying.,30,3
20,"I always wanna make sure that my lips are super, super clean.",31,3
20,"And sometimes when you look at your lips, they look okay.",33,3
20,"And then you put like a dark color on or red or, you know, a mattifying product and you can sometimes see that dead skin.",34,14
20,"So just to be on the safe side, I'm gonna use our Yo-Glo and this is in our Tropical Fruits.",35,37
20,I'm just grabbing literally a pea size.,36,0
20,And I'm using a circular motion.,37,-1
20,"And yeah, I'm gonna feel the dead skin telling off.",38,14
20,And I love Yo-Glo for the lips.,39,3
20,I'm just gonna pat it off with a warm wet towel.,40,-1
20,I'm just gonna go ahead and I'm gonna apply a little bit of foundation all around my mouth.,41,0
20,"As I apply the lip product, I'm just gonna rub off any excess product off the lip here.",43,3
20,So I'm gonna apply our Hattabee D lip contour 2.0 in pinky brown.,44,3
20,And I'm just gonna start outlining my lips.,46,3
20,And I'm gonna go ahead and do the bottom as well.,47,-1
20,"And then after I do that, I do like to overline a little bit.",48,38
20,So I'm gonna go ahead and fix any areas that I may overline.,49,38
20,And then I'm gonna go ahead and begin with application.,50,-1
20,So you can see it's got this beautiful tone to it.,51,-1
20,"So I got to sit with Bill Keece when she was developing this color and she just had the most amazing personality, the most amazing energy.",53,6
20,"And she's so obsessed with all of you guys, making sure that you guys get your beauty fix and feel really empowered and beautiful through all of that.",54,6
20,Also those date nights when you wanna be a little extra sexy.,59,-1
20,But Bill Keece did her thing.,60,6
20,She made this beautiful lip shade.,61,3
20,It's kind of like a muted pinky brown.,63,-1
20,So this color has now set and you can see it kind of got a little bit more muted.,65,-1
20,And you guys know of course our liquid lipsticks are completely transfer free.,66,3
20,So it is not gonna transfer onto your mask or you know your clothing or any of those things.,67,16

21,I'm actually just gonna put on my lips raw with like no lip line or nothing just to show you how beautiful it is.,12,3
21,But sometimes I also put it on top of my liquid lipstick too to give me a little bit of a nudeer kind of glow.,13,3
21,But I'm gonna show you how it applies.,14,-1
21,"It's a little brown, little nude.",15,1
21,"And I don't know, these I feel like you can just apply it on top of everything.",17,0
21,I think it's one of the best nude I've ever seen in my entire life.,18,1
23,"You can use it on your elbows, your knees, your feet, your scalp, your scalp, your bikini line, or balls.",0,0
23,I gotta show this to you.,2,9
23,I asked my husband if he wants me to exfoliate his balls.,4,-1
23,So I have a really important question for you.,7,-1
23,"Who says that I can use her yow glow for elbows, knees, feet, scalp, and balls?",8,-1
23,So I need to ask you and all of Instagram is awaiting your response to get your face in here.,16,-1
23,Can I use hoda katans yow glow to make your balls shine like the sun?,18,11
23,"Of course, it's over man's dream to have their balls shine like the sun and smooth his eggs.",19,-1
23,I look forward to purifying and beautifying your ball sack.,22,-1
23,"Well, we won't be sharing that on Instagram.",25,-1
23,That turns the service community guidelines all that nonsense.,27,-1
23,We're in swell with warm water and.,29,0
24,So we just got back to Dubai.,1,-1
24,So excited to be back here.,2,13
24,"Unfortunately, we had a product leak happen recently and it's a really special product.",3,-1
24,I'm really upset that it got leaked and it was leaking about a month ago and I thought I would just ignore it because this happens all the time.,4,-1
24,"I don't know how, but one of these Instagram accounts, they get products from our manufacturer.",5,-1
24,They're not finished within the production and they post them online and it's happened so many times.,6,-1
24,"In the beginning when it used to happen, I would get so frustrated.",7,-1
24,I would lose all my excitement.,8,-1
24,Like we spent years on developing these products and I lose all my excitement and then I decided just to start ignoring it.,9,27
24,"But now I've seen it posted so many times and so many people are tagging me and some things and so we're gonna, I'm actually gonna shoot a video right now.",10,-1
24,"I'm gonna go look lamb, shoot a live video for you guys and post it today.",11,-1
24,I'm gonna reveal the full product myself.,12,-1
24,"But you know, I just wish this person would stop.",13,23
24,They don't do it only to me.,14,-1
24,"They do it to a lot of brands and I don't think they realize how much effort goes into developing products like we spend years and it's not only me, it's a whole team of people spending years and they do it just for some clicks, like clickbait.",15,27
24,I'm not gonna tag them because I don't want to post their account and give them any more cloud.,18,9
24,But I'm gonna post a product.,20,-1
24,I don't want to be sad about it because I'm really excited about this product.,21,27
24,"You know, I was, I was hoping to avoid like just to ignore it, but you know, it is what it is and the product is amazing.",22,27
24,It's to me one of the most amazing complexion products that we have created to date if not the most amazing complexion product.,24,-1
24,"I'm excited to share it with you guys and I think we might actually just reveal the whole calendar for the year which might be a bad idea, but I just, I don't want to feel like I always have to be like worried about the next product launch being revealed.",26,13
24,So I'm gonna go ahead and reveal it with you guys.,27,9
24,I'm gonna shoot this video now post it this evening.,28,-1
25,"Foundation into the waters, whirl it around, apply it to your skin.",0,0
25,"This is a technique that is supposed to give you the longest wear application, non-transfer, and it's supposed to make your skin look more beautiful.",1,16
25,I want to give this a try.,2,21
25,"I got my glass of water, and then I'm putting my foundation.",3,0
25,I also feel like this is really wasteful.,4,-1
25,The foundation literally sticks to your brush.,7,-1
25,"Oh, I'm going to blend it in with another brush so I can get much more natural application.",9,17
25,Let's try it on the other side and compare.,11,2
25,So I'm just going to do half a squirt on the side.,12,0
25,I'm going to use a similar brush to spread it out.,13,17
25,"And then again, I'm going to use a similar brush to blend.",14,17
25,I do have a little more luminosity on this side than I do this side.,15,1
25,"Just a hint, which is nice, but we need to try the transfer test to see if this is really worth the hype.",16,-1
25,So I am going to put these on both sides and press really hard.,17,-1
25,I got a little bit of transfer.,18,2
25,"I just think that it's a little complicated, a little gross, and also a little wasteful.",22,-1
25,But I will say this is the hack that works.,23,20
26,I'm really excited to share with you guys something really special.,1,13
26,"Our amazing BAs who work in the stores in London, who are there hustling, working their butts off to make everyone out there so happy and to give them the products of their dreams to make them feel better.",2,-1
26,"You know, they work so hard and we have been dying to bring them to Dubai and actually do a little bit of a collab with them and create some exclusive shades with them.",3,-1
26,Bring them to our offices with them.,4,-1
26,"Kind of experience the dream come true because they make everyone's dream come true all the time, right?",6,5
26,So we were finally able to do it and I'm really excited.,7,13
26,One that's going to Herod's and then one that's going to Selfridges.,9,-1
26,Both these from Herod's and then Sana from Selfridges who both came and developed these beautiful shades.,10,1
26,I'm so obsessed with them and I actually got to meet with them and to kind of experience some of the shades that they were playing with.,11,-1
26,And it was it was such an amazing time and such an amazing experience.,12,5
26,So I'm going to show you guys the shades really quickly and there's also this really beautiful exclusive packaging.,13,-1
26,You can see we have this one for Selfridges which is the color that I'm wearing now and then we have this beautiful pinky nude that we call it Queen of Sheba and the girls actually helped us name it.,14,1
26,So this is Girl on Fire and has a selfie packaging and this says Queen of Sheba which is also the shade and it has this beautiful Herod's kind of line drawing which is really iconic.,15,1
26,So I'm really excited to do this with both of these amazing ladies and I'm so excited for you guys to see the colors and I can't wait for you guys to try them.,16,-1
26,So it is our liquid matte and these beautiful shades.,17,-1
26,They launch on the 13th of July so I can't wait for you guys to check it out.,18,13
26,They're also going to be doing a couple takeovers on our Instagram so make sure you check out both Billkees and Sana on our Instagram and you know give them some love as well.,19,-1
26,Love you guys so much and thank you Billkees and Sana so much.,20,31
27,"After 3 of how I found my mother's stalker living underneath her bed, disclaimer this is not my story time, it was sent to me on Instagram.",0,18
27,"For my mom's bed, I found her handwritten note from her stalker.",1,18
27,I couldn't bring myself to read it.,2,-1
27,I gave it to my mom and she read it.,3,-1
27,She cried and told me to pack a bag.,4,6
27,That night we went to sleep at a hotel and the cops came to check our house.,5,18
27,The cops said they found nothing in the house and it was safe for us to come back.,6,18
27,"Two days later I decided to come home from school early, but I knew that my mom wouldn't be home and I would be all alone.",7,-1
27,"And I walked up to the house, I noticed my mom's bedroom window was open.",8,18
28,I want to talk about something a little serious because I'm bothered.,1,36
28,"A few weeks ago, I posted a video of my sister, Alia, doing a little mascara hack.",3,-1
28,"If you guys are know, Alia, she's the one who gave me the $6,000 to borrow when I needed money to start my brand.",4,19
28,"You know, she's just like honestly, the most the sweetest kind of soul.",5,6
28,But she's this crazy mascara hack that she's always done since I was little.,6,-1
28,She pies mascara on and then she gets all over her lid.,8,0
28,"But somehow because she applies it in that uplifting way, it ends up really lifting her lashes.",9,0
28,But then she ends up like looking kind of crazy and then she removes it.,11,0
28,But like the effect is beautiful.,12,-1
28,So I asked her to shoot it for me and to do like a video with legit lashes and she did it and I posted it.,13,-1
28,But the amount of comments that we got that were so mean people were talking about her skin.,14,6
28,"They were saying, you know, like, why does her skin look this way?",15,-1
28,Does she not take care of her skin?,16,-1
28,"You know, she just broke down and started crying so bad.",18,6
28,She felt so horrible and she ended up deleting the post.,19,6
28,And she was just so sad and I really broke my heart to see that because she's so beautiful.,20,6
28,"She doesn't take care of herself, but that's because she's so selfless.",21,6
28,"She should be more, you know, taking care of herself.",23,6
28,"It just really upset me to see so many mean comments and she was like, oh my God, I just, I want to see Dr. Marta.",24,6
28,"This is like, you know, she's said to me, she's like people criticize you of your most vulnerable things that you feel so bad about.",25,6
28,"And then they say, oh, but you're not supposed to filter.",26,-1
28,You're not supposed to do these things.,27,-1
28,You're not supposed to do the Botox.,28,-1
28,She is so beautiful and she's so amazing.,30,6
28,"And here she is feeling like crap because of some keyboard crusaders who honestly, if probably met her in real life would probably be nice to her, let's be honest.",31,6
28,It just really brings up a point.,32,36
28,Like I really want to create an environment where people are really nice to each other and you don't know what anybody's going through.,33,15
28,Like you don't know the energy sometimes it takes to do a video and then to be ridiculed for things that you feel so insecure about.,34,-1
28,"If people don't know everybody else's insecurities, you might see a picture of me and you might think I think I'm all that.",35,15
28,"I mean, while I'm dealing, and I'll tell you this right now, I am dealing all the time with issues of even liking the way that I look.",36,-1
28,I know how to serve like a boss as pose.,37,-1
28,"I struggle with my own insecurities of accepting myself, right?",38,15
28,"But we do these videos to educate, to, to, to, you know, to some mean sometimes it's fun.",39,-1
28,"But then to get that amount of ridicule sometimes on things that are so mean, it's just why?",41,-1
28,"Why can't we be cheering each other on from the sidelines, you know?",43,13
28,And I've been talking a lot about these filter uses like all these issues.,44,-1
28,"And why do you think the problem exists because of things like this, where people will go out and they'll, they'll ridicule each person as if they're perfect and they'll try to find all the weaknesses.",45,-1
28,"And it's just, it's not right.",46,-1
28,"Like we want up to create a place where people are more confident in themselves, but then we have all these issues of people saying all these things.",47,15
28,"I'll be the first to tell you, like I over Botox overfilled, overfiltered, over Photoshopped, overface tuned my face because of all these insecurities.",48,0
28,And I still didn't feel like that good looking.,49,6
28,And it's really hard to be in that point where you can accept yourself and put yourself out there and be vulnerable.,50,15
28,And it really upset me that people were so mean to her.,52,6
28,This video is not only for my sisters.,53,-1
28,"For everybody out there who's getting me comments, like we just, we gotta have more respect for people putting themselves out there.",54,23
28,"Maybe you don't like the contact, okay?",55,-1
28,"If you don't like the contact, keep scrolling.",56,-1
28,Do you have to comment and say something mean?,57,23
28,Just also think about the people out there who are trying their best to do things.,59,-1
28,And maybe that little comment that you're gonna say to them is gonna make them feel a little bit better.,60,23
28,And we don't know what happens to people with that moment happens.,61,-1
28,Like have you ever got any comment?,62,23
28,Did it just really hurt you?,63,5
28,Did it really take you off?,64,-1
28,"Or on the other side, have you gotten a really nice comment?",65,23
28,You don't want something that maybe you didn't feel good about and somebody just made you feel so different?,66,15
28,Like let's just think about these things guys.,67,-1
28,"Cause it really, it really, really, really upsets me.",68,-1
28,You guys know I've been talking about trying to be more filter free and I'm seeing Dr. Marcia again to melt some more fillers.,69,-1
28,I feel really excited about that.,70,-1
28,But I'm also not done with my journey of all these things cause I still have all these insecurities.,73,15
28,"I'm trying my best, but you know, it's hard.",74,-1
28,It's really hard when you get constant criticism.,75,23
28,And at that point she felt ugly because of what everybody else thought not because of the way she felt.,76,6
28,"If we can just be a little kind or to each other and just be more considerate, I think it would really go a long way.",78,-1
30,"So baking, one of my favorite things in the entire world has come back in such a vengeance.",0,-1
30,I don't know if it's because we're all sick of quarantine.,1,-1
30,"We all want to get out, but glam, super high, very glamorous glam is back and I'm not going to lie, I am very happy.",2,2
30,"So I have applied my foundation, my contour, my concealer, I'm just going to quickly apply a little bit of this beautiful cream blush.",5,-1
30,Then we are going to bake.,6,-1
30,I actually love this whole process.,7,-1
30,"It allows your skin to really look completely airbrushed, completely flawless.",8,16
30,"And that baking just brings everything together in such a lifting, beautiful way.",9,-1
30,I am now going to go in with my easy bake baking powder.,10,-1
30,I'm going to grab this cute little spunch.,11,-1
30,I'm going to go right under my eyes and I'm going to drag this out.,12,0
30,Does anybody know what this is?,13,-1
30,"Call this, this is called your nasal obea fold.",14,22
30,I'm going to go right in there.,16,2
30,I'm going to go right here.,17,2
30,You can connect it to the corner of your mouth.,18,3
30,You can see I've kind of stopped where my brow is.,19,0
30,I'm going to apply just whatever is left to my chin.,20,0
30,"Then on my forehead, I'm going to leave it for just a couple of minutes and I'm going to come back.",21,0
30,"Okay, I'm going to go ahead and start moving it.",22,2
30,I'm going to start with areas that I want to look less defined.,23,-1
30,"So right here, blending out around the eye, doing this cream foundation, this cream blush cream, everything.",24,0
30,And then applying a powder gives you this beautiful sculpted ultra glamorous look.,25,0
30,"Also when you do this, your makeup will last forever.",26,0
30,"Which like no matter what trend you're following, you want your makeup to last.",27,0
30,I'm going to finish the other side and I'll be right back.,28,2
30,So I am done with my powder.,29,0
30,You can see how my complexion looks.,30,14
30,Do you guys like this matte look?,32,10
31,"All right guys, so you guys know Rose Quartz our first collection for our brand and a collaboration with Hood of Beauty and Wishful is launching tomorrow.",0,4
31,"I can't believe it, I'm so excited.",1,-1
31,"But more than anything, seeing your comments has been amazing.",2,23
31,"And the place that I think everyone's been really, really excited like the most about, I think a little surprise, a little surprise and delight has been around our face gloss.",3,-1
31,"And there's been a lot of comments around this, a lot.",4,23
31,"A lot of people are saying this is the most talked about highlighter, I see you guys, I love you guys.",5,33
31,I think some people have been looking at the product and saying it looks like a Petri dish.,6,12
31,But they have been so amazed at the applications.,8,-1
31,"So I'm just gonna really quickly show it to you guys and you guys can see it has these pearls, these beautiful little drops of pearls and it's encapsulated in this gel.",9,25
31,It's like the new way to highlight.,11,33
31,Nobody wants that shimmery glittery highlight anymore.,12,33
31,We all want our skin to look duly and natural and sexy and healthy.,13,14
31,And that is what this highlighter does.,14,33
31,"Because it has that little gel like kind of formula, little finish with the shimmer, it gives you this like pop of shimmer and highlight but more of this like wet doingness.",15,25
31,"It's not sticky, not tacky, it does dry down, but it is so, so gorgeous.",16,0
31,So I'm gonna do a click application and show you guys how it wears.,17,-1
31,And you can see a little bit of the shimmer swirl but most of it is just the gel.,19,25
31,"And I'm gonna apply it on my face and what's really interesting about it is because it does have that gel, it kind of fills your pores in.",20,16
31,So a lot of times highlighters actually kind of accentuate your pores.,21,-1
31,This actually kind of minimizes your pores.,22,16
31,"When I first was actually sharing the application with my team of the way I like to use it, somebody asked me would you put it all over your face and I was like, I don't know, I'm not really sure.",23,0
31,"And then I put it all over my face and I was like, actually I take that back 100% I would put this all over my face.",24,0
31,So I'm gonna show you guys putting it on my cheeks here.,25,-1
31,"Whatever is left on my fingers, I'm just going to take on to the rest of my face and it's gonna get me a nice, amount of deueness.",26,0
31,"If you guys can see that, it actually has softened up my pores, it's softened my skin and it makes my skin look healthy.",27,16
31,"A lot of times when you put these kind of products on the accentuate it, you look almost look better than without it than you do with it.",28,16
31,"And this is kind of the contrary, it actually makes your skin look more beautiful and more healthy, which is really, really amazing.",29,16

37,"So my first big money move when I was starting Head of Beauty, it was definitely a little bit of a risk for me, but I asked my sister if I could borrow $6,000.",3,19
37,"I ended up using the $6,000 to buy lashes, and I bought, you know, I think about 7,000 pairs of lashes at the time.",4,0
37,"And when I first found out about false lashes, I remember being like, this is like the best kept secret.",5,0

37,"And when we sold our lashes, we sold out immediately.",14,0

38,"This is our icy, this is our spicy.",2,11
38,I love to plump my lips.,6,3
38,I have had lip fillers done over and over again.,7,3
38,"I've melted my lip filler, added it back in.",8,3
38,"I think that it adds a very feminine, very soft look to your appearance.",10,16
38,But there is a limit with how much you can actually put in your lips before you start looking a little funny.,11,3
38,So that's why I've become obsessed with that plumped flush lip effect that you get from using a plumper.,12,3
38,It just makes your lips look juicy overall and I just love it.,13,3
38,I'm gonna open these up and I'm gonna show you what's inside.,14,34
38,It literally looks like a blue slushy.,16,-1
38,"Instead of going hot and making your lips plump, this is actually going to provide some cooling effect.",17,3
38,But it allows you to have blood flow to go to your lips and plump your lips.,18,3
38,So this has some amazing ingredients inside of it.,20,30
38,All the goodness that we had in our OG silk bomb.,21,-1
38,"You got the soybean extract, you got the licorice, and then we've added in some extra goodness to give you super plump, delicious lips over time.",22,3
38,So you're gonna get an immediate plump and you're gonna get long term plump as well from using this product.,23,3
38,"It's got the blue and we have a warning on the back, warning icy baby and this is flaming baby.",24,11
38,So this one is pretty hot.,25,1
38,We actually have some really interesting ingredients.,26,30
38,"Again, the classic nourishing ingredients of our original silk bomb was some added goodness.",27,30
38,This actually has Sushwan pepper extract.,28,30
38,You guys know I love hot sauce.,29,11
38,My team was inspired by the fact that it eats so much hot sauce when we created this.,30,11
38,We also wanted that hot sauce color so you can see it's got a little redness.,31,11
38,The blue one smells like a blue raspberry slushy and this one smells like a sweet chili sauce.,32,11
38,So you guys love that sweet chili sauce.,33,11
38,So you can see we had a lot of fun when we created these products.,35,27
38,"We had a lot of fun with the packaging, but also we wanted to go really far in making it something that would become an absolute staple.",36,1
38,"For the second video I'm gonna be using our spicy, which is my favorite.",37,11
38,I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to apply this onto the lips.,38,3
38,It is really nice and glossy.,41,10
38,"I can feel it working, but it's like a subtle build.",42,-1
38,"It doesn't like immediately feel like you're lips on fire, which I love.",43,3
38,I'm gonna go a little higher here because I want my cupids bow to be a little swollen.,44,0
38,That's tingling a little bit more.,45,5
38,I would say it takes about look good like 15 seconds to really start to feel like your lips are on fire.,46,3
38,"When we were creating our silk bomb icing and spicy, we wanted to make sure it wasn't an uncomfortable feeling.",47,-1
38,"A lot of lip clippers sometimes you put them on and immediately your lips are so irritated, so inflamed and you want to remove it.",48,3
38,"Some people like it, some people find it uncomfortable.",49,-1
38,"From me personally, it was uncomfortable.",50,5
38,"I wanted a slow, steady kind of feeling.",51,5
38,"Sometimes when I'm feeling extra crazy, I will actually layer them on top of each other and you get that kind of cooling and heat effect at the same time.",52,-1
38,I am feeling the intensity now with that.,53,5
38,"Woo, it's a little bit intense now, but it's all good.",54,5
38,So you can definitely apply this on top of your favorite lip product.,55,3
38,You can apply a small amount.,56,0
38,You can go really generous like I just did or you can even use this within your skincare.,57,0
38,I actually use these at night with my skincare.,58,-1
38,"When I wake up after using this, my lips literally look fuller, more plump and I am obsessed with the way that they look when I wake up.",59,3
38,I can't wait for you guys to try this.,60,21
38,Can't wait to see what you guys think.,61,9
38,Do not be afraid if you haven't tried lip clippers before.,62,3

40,"And I was like, okay, say it more, fam, we're going.",23,2
40,Probably the hardest part of my life was actually just struggling with my identity to accept myself and who I was.,24,15
40,My ideal of beauty I thought was blonde hair and blue eyes.,25,6
40,I didn't know that I could also be beautiful.,26,6
40,"Beauty is something that is so transformational and it makes you feel like you have so much power and you feel like a different person, but you're never a different person.",27,6

41,Self love has been something that I've really kind of leaned into over the past few years.,6,15
41,"You know, I just moved and I was surrounded by Rose Quartz.",7,4

41,It was like the most amazing thing I had ever experienced.,10,5
41,So I put Rose Quartz all over the house like everywhere.,11,4
41,"I was really inspired by this Rose Quartz and so we decided to actually, you know, make a Rose Quartz palette and a full collection.",13,4
41,Which I'm so excited to share with you guys.,14,13

41,This is our new Rose Quartz beautiful palette from Honey Beauty.,17,4
41,You can see we have this beautiful Rose Quartz design and it's a little hollow.,18,4
41,There's also these different layers on the packaging so you can get like this different kind of Rose Quartz effect.,19,4
41,But the palette also itself has like this really cool kind of injection that looks like an actual Rose Quartz.,21,4
41,I'm going to show you guys the palette now because I can't wait for you guys to see it.,23,-1

41,And I think you guys are too because I know you guys are like loving the grays that we're putting out there.,26,-1
41,And of course you can see we have this beautiful kind of jelly crystal looking shade right here.,27,1
41,It looks like crystals inside of gels and this is called love stone.,29,12
41,We borrowed a little inspiration from our naughty nude that slippery shade.,30,1
41,We decided to actually bring that formula back.,31,30
41,And I remember asking the team I was like can we actually make it look like shards?,32,12
41,Can we make it look like little pieces of stone?,33,12
41,So you can see here that's exactly what it looks like.,34,-1
41,And it's such an amazing shade.,35,1
41,It's actually so amazing on so many levels you're going to see me using the tutorial.,36,-1
41,But it's also like just one that you have to play with.,37,18
41,You can do so many things with it.,38,-1
41,We have a lot of different textures in here.,39,-1
41,We have these really beautiful kind of creamy shimmeries.,40,25
41,And then we also have these duo crumbs.,41,-1
41,So I have to tell you guys I've never seen duo crumbs like this within a palette.,42,-1
41,I've seen this within a pigment like loose pigment but like this intense like this kind of duo chrome where it's like very many different shades depending on how you move it.,43,1
41,And then you also see we have this like marble kind of effect duo crumbs.,44,-1
41,So depending on the way that you swatch it depending on where you touch it you're going to get a different effect.,45,-1
41,We have to post a picture of the swatches because you have to see them.,46,-1
41,They are just so beautiful in the way they look on the different skin tones.,47,-1
41,I'm really proud of this palette.,49,8
41,So that's the palette my day tutorial.,50,8
41,So I'm going to show you guys how I got this look.,51,9
41,It was really easy like super easy.,52,5
41,But I want to show you guys the other piece of the collection because I'm obsessed with them.,53,-1
41,We also have our beautiful rose quartz brushes as well.,54,4
41,These are actually not real words quartz.,55,4
41,They are plastic and they've been designed to kind of emulate rose quartz.,56,4
41,They are also synthetic and vegan of course like all of our brushes.,58,-1
41,"So we have a blender brush, literally my favorite blender brush in the entire world.",59,17
41,We also have a shade brush which is like the perfect brush for actually shading under your eye.,60,-1
41,And then we also have a smudge brush.,61,17
41,"This is really great when you're doing liner, when you're doing any type of like you know kind of more detailed work.",62,7

41,You can see it just looks amazing on the lips.,69,3
41,And we also have our beautiful face gloss again in this gorgeous packaging.,70,-1
41,"But more than anything, I'm just obsessed with this product.",71,27
41,This I feel is like the future of highlighting.,72,33
41,So you can see it is kind of similar to that slippery shade that we had in our 90 nude.,73,1
41,It's also very similar to love stone that we have in our rose quartz palette.,74,4
41,It is this beautiful kind of gel formulation with these shimmery like just drops of pearls.,75,25
41,"Because it has these two different shades of pearls inside of it, it works for all skin tones.",76,-1
41,"So when you mix the two together and it is a little bit sheer, it just kind of glazes the skin in the most beautiful way.",77,-1
41,"We also did a collab with Wishful and as you can see, we also have this beautiful kind of rose quartz finish on the packaging here too.",78,4
41,"And as you can see, it has this beautiful kind of finish, very pearly, very pretty.",82,1
41,This actually has crushed rose quartz mineral powder inside of it.,83,4
41,So this mask actually lifts it tightens it brightens it on clogs pores.,84,16
41,So that is the full collection of products that we have launching for our rose quartz collection.,87,4
41,I'm actually going to go into the tutorial and I'm going to teach you guys how I got this full look.,88,-1

41,And I'm going to use the blender brush and I'm just going to go ahead and grab the shade here and I'm going to go here and I'm just going to start applying it right over my lid.,91,17
41,And I don't have a primer on but I do have concealer on my eyes and I'm going to start working this kind of upwards too.,92,26
41,So I'm not applying a lot of product.,93,0
41,I'm like barely dipping my brush in because I want to build.,94,17
41,We do need to go super intense and I'm doing these little circular motions as you can see.,95,-1
41,"Right now I am going to grab this beautiful mantras shade which is this gorgeous kind of like gray, cuckoo-y brown.",96,1
41,So I'm going to grab the same brush and I'm going to do a little bit of the shape here.,98,17
41,"Okay, and I'm going to go here on the brow bone.",99,0
41,I'm actually going to grab a little bit of the gratitude matte brown.,100,10
41,It's such a beautiful kind of blending shade and I'm just going to kind of use it here to blend out the edges here.,101,1
41,And now I'm just going to grab a little bit of that mantra and I'm going to go really nice under my brow.,102,0
41,I love this kind of really over shadowed kind of appearance.,103,1
41,"I feel like it looks so sexy, so smoky, so sultry.",104,1
41,I am now going to grab the shade brush and I'm going to mix all the shades that I used.,105,17
41,"Gratitude, precious mantra and I'm going to put them underneath my eye and I'm just grabbing that and I'm going right on the bottom lash line.",106,0
41,Sometimes I just close my eyes and I just go back and forth.,107,0
41,"And you can, if you want to kind of connect that here.",108,-1
41,I am going to start with a fun stuff.,109,-1
41,"That was fun, but now we're going to get a little bit more fun.",110,-1
41,I'm going to grab moon magic and I'm just going to go ahead and I'm just swatching it across my lid.,111,-1
41,I'm even going on top of the shadowy part too.,112,-1
41,"If you have big fingers like me, you can switch to a brush, but look at that payoff.",113,17
41,"I literally just used a swatch with my fingers and it was just like, I've never seen this in a palette.",114,-1
41,I've seen it in loose pigments.,115,1
41,I've never seen this in a palette before.,116,-1
41,I'm going to grab a little tiny amount of concealer just a small amount and I'm just going to put it right here.,117,26
41,I'm kind of like outlining right below where that shadowy bit was.,118,-1
41,And then you can take left-stown this beautiful shimmery kind of glossy tone and I am just going to take a really small brush and I'm going to put this right on top of where I put the concealer and this will intensify that glossiness.,119,10
41,It really makes the lid look like so wet.,120,-1
41,I'm going to grab a little bit more of moon magic with this brush and I'm going to go over that too and let that stick to the left stone too.,121,-1
41,It's going to be a little bit more set.,122,2
41,You can see my eyes look hella glossy right now.,123,10
41,"Okay, so this is a little bit of a gray smoky eye and then you can see by using these beautiful duo-cromes that are so intense and so beautiful.",124,1
41,"We really kind of made it look very just shimmery and intense but also kind of like, I don't know, is it a daytime look?",125,-1
41,I feel like it could be somebody's day.,126,5
41,It's my daytime look for sure.,127,-1
41,And I'm just going to now finish by applying a little liner and a little mascara and then I'm going to come back and show you guys the final look.,128,0
41,I have an obsessed with this look.,130,37
41,It was really easy to do too.,131,5
41,I'm going to finish up and look using our silk bomb of Rose Quartz in Love Stone actually has a lot of really similar shimmers to the Love Stone inside of the palette.,133,12
41,"I just love this formula, the shimmer.",134,25
41,This is the Rose Quartz Face Gloss.,136,4
41,So I'm going to go ahead and swatch it.,138,-1
41,You can see you don't really get that much shimmer but you get just a nice amount.,139,25
41,So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to apply it using my fingers on as a highlighter and I have this nice duiness and I have this Perl finish and it just looks amazing on the face.,140,-1
41,So you can actually go all over if you want and you can see how beautiful that looks so dewy but you can really play with this.,141,19
41,You can apply it really wherever you want.,142,0
41,I love to put it on my cheeks.,143,0
41,You can also put it on your eyes as well.,144,0
41,"I mean, if you have like no makeup on you can put it on top of your skin care and it will look so healthy and so dewy.",145,0
41,And you can see it just gives you this like nice little glossiness to your skin.,146,-1
41,Thank you guys so much for watching.,147,31
41,"I hope that you guys are inspired by, you know, not necessarily the product but the meanings behind the products.",148,27
41,"You know, a lot of times when we are developing products for me personally, it is my personal life journey through products.",149,27
41,So I hope that even if you don't buy anything or try anything that you do feel the need to love yourself more and that you do love yourself more because you are worth loving and you are worth being every single bit of who you are meant to be.,150,15
41,"And I really hope that for you, for each and every one of you.",151,-1

41,I love you guys so much.,154,31
41,So many guys so much love.,155,31
42,I just want to show you something and what I get every single day.,0,9
42,That is just from one video that someone reposted on Instagram.,1,-1
42,Then comments won't go unless that person deletes the comments.,2,23
42,They wouldn't even go if someone reported the comment.,3,23
42,"I still am strong, but I haven't felt this way ever since I started social media.",4,-1
42,I get this every day and people don't understand I'm human being.,5,-1
42,"I understand I get so much positive comments, so much support, but when I get comments like that, they're so powerful.",6,23
42,I really do try my hardest and I try my hardest to reply about as many positive comments I can and delete all the hate comments.,7,23
42,But being told that I don't wash and commit suicide and to go kill myself.,8,15
42,"And all the comments that I've just shown you, it hurts.",9,23
42,When will social media stop this?,10,-1
42,I saw this video and I was so distraught and disgusted and emotionally hurt.,11,-1
42,I was so upset to see some of the things that happen on social.,12,5
42,It really hurt my soul and it's something that we all need to be very aware of.,13,5
42,Some of the ugliness that happens on social.,14,6
42,"I know we know, but when you see videos like this showing everything that somebody goes through, it's wrong guys.",15,-1
42,So I just want to say a quick message to this beautiful queen.,17,6
42,"First of all, honey, you're so beautiful.",18,6
42,You have beauty inside and out.,20,6
42,"And I'm not talking about that kindness beauty that people sometimes shit on, which is really important actually.",21,6
42,I'm talking about your amazing confidence and shame on those people who are so insecure with your amazing beautiful confidence that they themselves are trying to tear you down so that you stop.,22,-1
42,"Girl, your brows, your eyes, your lips, I'm paying money to try to get lips like yours.",24,3
42,You have so many beautiful qualities I don't even get started.,25,6
42,"But you got that confidence, honey.",26,-1
42,"That most people don't, I don't have.",27,-1
42,And I'm so proud of you for doing what you do.,28,-1
42,"And don't you, don't you stop.",29,-1
42,Don't stop because of the haters out there.,30,23
42,They just have some ugliness inside of them and they're deflecting it on you.,31,6
42,And I'm so proud of you.,32,-1
42,And like honestly watching your video made me very emotional on so many levels.,33,5
42,And it hurt to see what's happening.,34,-1
42,But you are a part of a change.,35,36
42,Don't stop because of these people who are trying to get you to stop.,36,23
42,Because they don't understand everything that you represent.,37,6
42,There's a lot of people out there for all the people who out there saying negative things.,38,-1
42,There's a hundred more out there cheering you on.,39,-1
42,And I'm sorry if we're not more vocal about it.,40,-1
42,And your beauty radiates on so many levels.,43,6
42,The beautiful energy that you exuberate through your videos.,46,5
42,Because there's so many people out there who love it and need you.,49,18
42,And to the people out there who cannot see it.,50,9
42,Because they really can't recognize real beauty then.,52,6
43,"Alright my lips, I have gotten so many compliments on my lip shape recently.",0,3
43,"The truth is I have updated my lip contour technique, I'm so obsessed with it and I'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know.",1,3
43,"So the first thing that I do, I did scrub my lips, make sure you get rid of all the dead skin.",2,3
43,"So I am going to grab a really nice soft, nudy brown shade.",3,1
43,This is from our lip contour and sandy beige.,4,3
43,So first of all I'm going to look at the space around my lips and see what I need the most.,5,3
43,"So I can see there's a little extra space, just a little extra space here.",6,-1
43,So I'm going to start first by drawing the line here.,7,-1
43,Now I'm going to draw basically an arrow.,8,38
43,This is going to add dimension to the entire area over here and it's going to make it look like it's more contoured and it's not flat.,9,-1
43,Next I'm going to start by contouring the bottom area because I want to add dimension there too.,10,-1
43,I typically contour here and then I also going to go right here and here.,11,-1
43,I'm going to grab a eyeliner brush.,12,0
43,"This one is a little bit soft, it's not too pointed and I'm just going to go ahead and blend those lines out a little bit.",13,-1
43,"I'm not trying to buff them away, just breath them softly out.",14,0
43,I'm going to grab my foundation brush and I'm just going to now apply a little foundation to the area.,15,-1
43,I'm now just going to grab my favorite shade of lip line on this is pinky brown and I'm just going to go ahead and line with...,16,3
44,It's a very hot day and I'm heading to London so let's get ready.,0,2
44,My first step is to prep the skin with some wishful first trap serum.,1,0
44,A bit of calling the toolary eye cream and the eyes.,3,0
44,If you like some it calling underneath the eyes you have to try this.,4,0
44,"A tiny bit of dermal eye cream, active moisture, moisturise.",5,0
44,"Because it's super hot I'm actually going to be using the YSL Broughton Lotion just on basically the bits that I get really oily, okay my tea zone.",6,3
44,Because I don't want to look like an oily mess I'm actually going to be using a herders foundation stick just because I want to really matte.,7,-1
44,I don't want to look like a sweaty mess.,8,0
44,I actually use my favourite brush I've been memories with by Real Techniques and it is the brush 230.,9,17
44,I feel like it just is so easy to blend like anything.,10,-1
44,So for concealer I'm going to actually use a NARS Vajoy concealer.,11,26
44,I thought this concealer is literally amazing.,12,26
44,"I feel like it's creamy, I feel like it's easy to blend and you know it just does the job and doesn't go all lightly or patchy.",13,10
44,That's my skincare and my base face done so I'll see you in part two.,14,14
47,"Oh my god, you guys know I love a good lift.",0,0
47,"So you're supposed to take a concealer, that is a couple shades lighter than your normal concealer.",2,26
47,"I'm gonna apply it here, here, and here.",3,-1
47,I'm gonna see how this works.,6,-1
47,"Okay, yeah, I mean, definitely got a little lift already, but the powder is really worth that.",7,0
47,"Okay, I'm gonna grab a little powder now.",9,0
47,I'm gonna put it right here.,10,2
47,"All right, I'm gonna finish my makeup and come back, but this is insane.",13,0
47,My face is so lifted on this side.,14,0
47,"My face looks so lifted, so snatched.",17,0
47,I am obsessed with this hack.,18,20
47,"Sometimes the hacks that I find on TikTok works, sometimes I don't.",19,20
47,This one I'm gonna be using for the rest of my life.,20,27
48,"So I'm gonna show you guys my three favorite ways to apply sunscreen, sunblock, after you apply your makeup.",0,32
48,One thing people don't really realize is sunscreen doesn't last all day long.,1,32
48,"You put it on and after every two to three hours, you need to reapply it.",2,0
48,"So I actually like to put it on underneath my makeup, but then I also like to find different ways of applying it on top.",3,0
48,One of my favorite ways is to actually use a mist.,4,0
48,"This is one of my favorite mist, it's from Fallorga.",5,11
48,"And it is a hydrating mist, and it's so easy to apply.",6,0
48,"It actually gives your skin a little bit of a glow as well, which a lot of sunscreens do.",7,-1
48,"And it's really, really, really easy to apply over and over and over again.",8,0
48,"Normally what I would do, I would kind of step back, move my hair back, move my clothing back, apply like that.",9,0
48,It will make your skin a little glossy.,10,-1
48,"You can take a dry sponge or a damp sponge, and just tap it in.",11,-1
48,"The good thing about this is it's really, really easy to apply throughout the day.",12,0
48,You wanna make sure they don't have too much oil in them.,13,-1
48,"Otherwise, you're gonna ruin your makeup.",14,0
48,Another way to reapply your sunscreen is to use a sunscreen powder.,15,32
48,"This is in the form of middle powders, usually it can sometimes be mixed with other really beautiful ingredients as well, but these are actually really, really great.",16,10
48,They're not necessarily the best to use if you're gonna be taking photos.,17,24
48,"They don't photograph very well, but they are super easy to wear.",18,-1
48,And they also actually kind of sometimes will smooth out any imperfections as well.,19,-1
48,"Because they're mineral based, they do show in photos, but it actually looks really great in person.",20,1
48,So this is one I had bought from Supergoop.,21,-1
48,"I love this, it's an SPF 30, and it has the powder in here.",22,29
48,"And the way you kinda do it, you kinda open it up.",23,34
48,"I'm gonna take the little sifter out here, kinda as a little sifter.",24,26
48,"So you just kind of twist it, then you kinda open it up.",25,-1
48,"You have a little bit of a powder, and you can just apply it all over.",26,0
48,This is a more soft form of sunblock.,27,32
48,"So this is really great just if you're getting exposure, just by being in a window.",28,-1
48,"If you're gonna be out with the sun, you're gonna want a stronger cover.",29,32
48,So this is kinda like the medium to light protection.,30,-1
48,"I saw something really cute on TikTok from Kavi Kodra, where he basically took a sunblock.",31,20
48,And I actually thought this was genius.,32,5
48,He put it on the back of his hand.,33,0
48,"He can use a nice amount, and he took a damp beauty blender, and he basically just buffed it into the face.",34,28
48,So you kinda do this until it's almost gone.,35,34
48,And you could apply it on the face.,37,0
48,"I do feel like this, you should do several times.",38,18
48,"If you're gonna be in the sun to really protect your skin, like I would probably put about four times of what I just applied on my hand.",39,32
48,And I would split my face into four quadrants and apply that.,40,0
48,People really underestimate how much coverage or how much sunblock they need to use.,41,32
48,"I do this all the time when I'm in the sun, even after you apply all the protection, you need advice.",42,32
48,And there's some really cute vices out there.,43,35
48,I wear it every single day when I go for my walks.,45,0
48,"Don't forget to do your decal day, your arms, your body, your lips, your hands.",47,3
48,Make sure you saturate yourself with sunblock if you're gonna be in the sun.,48,32
48,Make sure you always look for good sunblock.,49,32
48,This has four pluses so you know it's good.,51,-1
50,"could glowish by hood of beauty be the hottest, do-ey skin tint to the summer?",0,11
50,Let's put it to the test.,1,2
50,Glowish's hood is new multi-do skin tint.,2,-1
50,This skin tint comes in 13 stretchable shades.,3,-1
50,I picked up 01 Fair because bitch look at me.,4,-1
50,You can wear this one of two ways.,5,0
50,"One is a no makeup look to give you that healthy, glowy looking skin that we all love.",6,-1
50,"Or you can mix it in with your favorite foundation to give you that perfect, do-ey finish.",7,0
50,As always hood of beauty is cruelty free.,8,-1
50,"I'm not babbling, let's get this on the face.",9,-1
50,"On this side of my face, I'll use a brush and on this side of my face, I'll use a sponge.",10,0
50,I zoomed you in because I want you to see like my real ass skin.,11,-1
50,"Oh right away, I can tell this is really luminous.",13,-1
50,Already look at this beautiful glow.,14,11
50,Let's go with the sponge on the other side.,15,-1
50,That covered my redness and I love how my skin looks.,16,14
50,Let me finish the face and meet you in natural lights so we can really see how the skin looks.,17,14
50,The word of the day is skin.,18,14
51,So we got a lot of questions about why we chose not to use SPF inside of our new multi-do skin tint by Glowge.,1,29
51,It's what I'm actually wearing almost no complexion.,2,14
51,It's really mostly this to show a quick tutorial coming your way.,3,-1
51,But the reason why we did not choose to use SPF you actually won't use you won't see in any of our complexion products.,4,29
51,And that is a very purposeful and a very intentional decision.,5,5
51,I personally love to wear SPF.,6,29
51,I love to make sure that my skin is being protected especially the skin on my face.,7,-1
51,So I care a lot about what I put on my skin.,10,-1
51,"But SPF and makeup inside of makeup, I don't believe it's an actual thing that works.",11,29
51,"I've had the opportunity over the last 10 plus years since we've had our blog to interview so many amazing, like so many of the top dermatologists in the world, some of the top scientists who are actually developing skin care products in the world.",12,-1
51,And all of them have always told me over and over and again over again.,13,-1
51,SPF inside of makeup does not work.,14,29
51,You're always going to need to wear an SPF underneath your makeup.,15,29
51,"And if there is an SPF inside your makeup, it's never going to be enough.",16,29
51,It's never going to last long enough.,17,0
51,And it's going to also affect your makeup where and look.,18,-1
51,The right amount of sunscreen for your face is going to be two fingers full.,19,32
51,So you're going to want to fill this whole amount.,20,-1
51,"You're going to apply it on your fingers, spread it all over your face.",21,0
51,And you're going to need additional amount for your decalete.,22,-1
51,So applying a good amount of SPF and then if you want to apply your makeup afterwards and then continuously applying it throughout the day is the only way to get really proper protection from the sun.,23,29
51,I don't believe in SPF inside of makeup.,24,29
51,And all SPF is not created equal.,25,29
51,There's a lot of different levels of SPF.,26,29
51,"There's PA++++, which is the best kind.",27,-1
51,And there's some that are probably not as strong.,28,-1
51,But the reality is you really need to be applying it over and over and over again.,29,0
51,"Also, if anybody wants to get a little granular and a little scientific, you want to make sure that you UVA plus UVB blockers, not just 30 and 50 protection, which is what a lot of sunscreens have.",30,32
51,UVA rays can be really harsh on the skin.,31,32
51,And we want to make sure that we're just giving our skin the most the best type of protection.,32,-1
51,I also do recommend wearing a hat.,33,0
51,"It's really, really good to just, you know, put that those blockers on as much as you can.",35,-1
51,So I love you guys so much.,36,31
51,I hope this was helpful for everybody asking about why we don't have SPF inside of our makeup.,37,29
51,"And please, if you do see SPF inside of your makeup, it's not going to be enough protection.",38,29
51,You got to use extra SPF and you really got to protect your skin because you only get one skin.,39,29
51,"So, thank you guys so much, love, and we're going to be posting this look very soon.",41,31
51,"All I wore was like three products on my face, really, really easy to do.",42,0
51,I love you guys so much.,43,31
52,"Hey my loves, so I wanted to do a quick video because we've gotten a lot of questions about our packaging for Glowish.",0,11
52,"When we launched Glowish, we wanted to make sure that we were all about sustainability.",1,-1
52,The packaging is a little bit more simple.,2,1
52,"On the back of our multi-duse content, you see here 25% PCR.",3,24
52,"What PCR means, it's post-consumer recycled product.",5,-1
52,"So basically, it's from recycled plastic.",6,24
52,"You can see it's also hollow, so there's less plastic being used.",8,-1
52,It does give it a little bit of a foggy tint to it.,9,10
52,"It's not perfect, but it is completely clean.",10,6
52,"It's completely, it's done in a way that it's very sterilized.",11,-1
52,It's melted at very high temperatures.,12,-1
52,It's so much better for the environment.,13,24
52,We have gotten some comments about why it doesn't look as luxurious as some of the other Huttabee Dee products.,14,-1
52,And that is for a reason.,15,5
52,Some of those products have a lot of plastic and a lot of weight in them.,16,-1
52,"To be honest, we're trying to switch those over to PCR options because it is for a good cause.",17,-1
52,Just because sustainable doesn't mean it's inexpensive because a lot of times it is expensive.,18,-1
52,But it is really important for the environment.,19,24
52,And we all have a responsibility.,20,-1
52,We're very much conscious of what you guys feel and what you guys are saying.,21,13
52,So I'm sure other brands are as well.,22,-1
52,So please make sure you guys use your voice to demand more sustainability.,23,24
52,"For everybody who had questions, I hope that answered it.",24,-1
52,And I'll speak to you guys soon.,25,-1
53,"All right guys, I am so excited to share with you guys a very meaningful, very special palette.",0,8
53,Our new Rose Quartz eyeshadow palette.,1,4
53,This palette was inspired by so many things that I have gone through in my entire life.,2,8
53,I'm not sure if I share this with you guys before.,3,13
53,Our big palette's always kind of tell a story about vulnerability and confidence in some of the issues that I've had.,4,8
53,Self love is something I've talked to you guys about.,5,15
53,"It's something that is so important to me to everyone really because when you love yourself, when you accept yourself, that's truly when you find the most powerful version of yourself.",6,15
53,Rose Quartz is actually a very healing stone and it's the stone of unconditional love.,7,4
53,"I actually feel like this stone has been really amazing for me on a personal level, so within my relationships as well.",8,12
53,So I love them so much.,9,-1
53,And that's why this palette is our Rose Quartz palette.,10,4
53,So you can see we've injected some really cool pigments inside of it to give you this Rose Quartz finish and it's everywhere in the palette.,11,-1
53,"This is a very wearable but still very creative, very versatile palette.",12,8
53,"So I know when you guys try it, you're going to be so impressed with some of the formulations.",13,30
53,"I mean, this is literally like a cream shimmer.",14,25
53,"As you can see, we had this really beautiful texture, which is like this gel, almost type of formula and encapsulated inside of it are these shard-like chunks of shimmer and just these beautiful pearls.",16,25
53,This kind of looks like crushed stones.,17,12
53,This is Quartz as well as Cosmic Love.,18,4
53,"As have seen something similar to it and are not in nude, our Glowish Words is this marbleized cream texture that gives you a texture that is cream and powder.",19,1
53,"It's unbelievable, so blendable, so beautiful.",20,35
53,It's like nothing I've ever tried before.,21,21
53,"Our mats are beautiful, really pigmented, talc-free mats.",22,-1
53,"You guys know we spent a lot of time creating some of the most pigmented, most delicious, highly pay off pigments in the world.",24,1
53,And we also created these beautiful.,25,-1
53,They also have this rose quartz kind of finish.,26,4
53,These beautiful vegan brushes that we have created inspired by the palette and also the textures inside of the palette.,27,8
53,So they're going to give you maximum payoff as well.,28,-1
53,And we also have our silk balm rose quartz.,29,4
53,This is such a beautiful shade.,30,1
53,I wear this all the time.,31,0

54,"Um, if you excuse me, just woke up and my skin is a little red, I don't know why.",1,14
54,But I wanted to tell you something about Glowish that I love so much.,2,11
54,"And um, I'm not sure if you guys saw this, but we have ugly fruit inside of our Glowish product.",3,37
54,Why is it a talking about it?,6,36
54,Why am I talking about it?,7,36
54,"Um, because ugly fruit is something that is actually beautiful on many levels.",8,37
54,"First of all, ugly fruit and vegetables.",9,37
54,"A lot of times people don't realize this, but because they are imperfect, they actually, for the most part, end up getting destroyed.",11,6
54,"So, um, I don't know if you guys have ever seen fruits and vegetables grow.",12,37
54,"I grew up in Tennessee, I grew up in the south, and my mom, um, in our backyard, used to plant a lot of things, whatever she could like plant, she would plant.",13,-1
54,"And we used to have bell peppers and lots of tomatoes, fruits, you know, cucumbers, all these things, watermelon.",14,37
54,And some of them were pretty and some of them were ugly.,15,6
54,"But what happens in, um, in businesses, if they're growing them, if that's part of their business, they end up sometimes selling them for cheaper prices.",20,-1
54,"Sometimes giving them away, but most of the time they don't because I miss us with their business models.",21,19
54,"And then third, most, what happens most of the time is they end up destroying these perfectly fine, but just not beautiful fruits and vegetables.",22,37
54,"Like, how are we destroying perfectly good food?",24,24
54,"That's just like, that's a huge problem, not only because some people don't have food, but secondly, for our planet, right?",26,24
54,"If we are not, if we're wasting food, food waste is one of the worst things.",27,-1
54,"We know a lot of things are, or, you know, there's a lot of obvious culprits, but food waste is actually a huge issue because when you waste food, and you're destroying the food, right?",28,-1
54,"You're planting, you're using more water, you're, you're using more land to plant fruits and vegetables that will never be used.",29,37
54,"So food waste is a huge, huge, huge, huge issue.",32,24
54,And it's a big problem for the planet.,33,24
54,It's a big problem for all of our resources.,34,24
54,So the fact that we were able to put them inside of our products at Glowish made me so happy.,35,11
54,"One, because it is a huge sustainability aspect, but also they're so good for you.",36,19
54,So we use ugly bell peppers.,37,37
54,"They're packed full of Vitamin A, which is so amazing for your skin.",38,-1
54,"Vitamin A just helps to sell you a little turnover, makes your skin look more beautiful, more even toned.",39,16

54,And they're just really good for your skin.,44,16
54,They also have packed full of antioxidants.,45,-1
54,"They protect your skin from free radicals as well as damage from blue light exposure, which we are all getting way too much of right now from our phones, from the TV, from our computer screens.",46,16
54,"I mean, you don't really realize.",47,36
54,And I think that's really amazing.,48,5
54,"So I'm so obsessed with the fact we have a lot of other amazing ingredients like squaline, rose and a skin oil, a sheer better environment, e inside of our bronzer.",49,-1
54,But I was just so obsessed with the fact that I feel like we're doing really good with Glowish.,50,11
54,"You know, we're committing to, we're doing a lot of good.",51,-1
54,"It would be we don't always talk about it, but we're taking a stance on Glowish to make sure that everything is PCR.",52,11
54,So we're using recycled goods to make the products.,53,24
54,"All of our outer products are FSC certified, but our ingredients are also naturally derived and sustainable.",54,-1
54,"It makes me really emotional because that makes me feel like, you know, I feel like we try to do purposeful things all the time, but this one every single aspect of it is purposeful, every single aspect of it.",55,5
54,And I couldn't be more proud.,56,-1
54,"That's the good stuff that makes you, makes you really, really happy.",58,19
54,It's becoming more accessible for beauty brands to make the decision to be more sustainable.,59,24
54,And things are always pretty or perfect because of it.,60,6
54,"Like sometimes you could do use PCR or FSC and it's not as pretty, but it is good for the planet.",61,-1
54,So I hope you guys get to try this.,62,21
54,I'm obviously really passionate about it.,63,-1
